# Taylor-Series-Expansion...Numerical-Computing

**This is a simple python project to estimate the cosine of any given value**

Numerical Computing is a compulsory subject in Software Engineering, Computer Sciences, Data Sciences, Informatics as well as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Taylor series is a very fundamental expansion alogarithm which uses the sum of an infinite series to calculate a finite value. In modern calculus it is used to estimate trigonometric and inverse trigonometric values of a given value. 

It is a solution to Zeno's Paradox, named after Zeno of Elea, an ancient Greek philosopher , who thought that finding a finite value using the sum of an infinite series is practically impossible. A close solution to the Zeno's Paradox was developed by a 15th century Indian Mathematician and the founder of Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics, Madhava of Sangamagrama who used series expansion to estimate values. Later in 1715 Brook Taylor constructed a general method which was named Taylor series expansion.

A more generalized form of Taylor Series is Maclauri series which can also be implemented in python.
